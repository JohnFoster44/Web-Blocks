# 'Web Blocks'

A collection of pieces to build a prototype website for clients quickly.

# Experiments

Marked experiment are things I have seen online and tried to replicate as best as I could. 

The marquee experiment had an aesthetic that I really like!

# Hamburger CSS
A standard hamburger menu made and animated using pure CSS.

# Profile Card
a prototype of a profile card. The real experimentation was getting a gradient around the picture. This could be used for a business to showcase their beautiful staff.

# Responsive Navbar 
this is also a hamburger menu but different to the CSS one as its responsive - goes from desktop to mobile and changes based on that. Uses JS.
